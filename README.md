KIIT EduBuddy
AI-Powered Academic Assistant for KIIT Students and Educators

EduBuddy is a smart academic assistant designed to streamline access to categorized, insightful, and exam-oriented content using AI and NLP. Built with students in mind, it enables intelligent retrieval of previous year questions, conceptual and application-based queries, and semester-specific insights. For educators, it offers trend analysis tools to simplify question paper design.

Features:
AI-based Query Resolution (GPT-powered)
Downloadable Results (.txt, .pdf, .docx)
Chat History & Favorites
Voice-to-Text Response Reader
Frequent Topic Identification
Real-time Analytics Dashboard
Dark Mode Toggle
Secure Authentication & Logout
Quick-Access Buttons for FAQs

Project Goals:
Simplify access to exam-relevant resources
Personalize learning using intelligent data analysis
Support faculty in exam paper formulation
Promote AI integration in academic workflows

Architecture Overview:
Frontend: Flask-based responsive UI with support for bookmarks, dark mode, and voice interaction
Backend: Python APIs integrating a fine-tuned GPT-based LLM (TinyLlama)
Data Pipeline: Extracted and preprocessed past exam questions using OCR, Pandas, and TF-IDF
Dashboard: Analytics powered by Matplotlib, Seaborn, and interactive filters

Tech Stack:
Component	Tools/Frameworks
Frontend	Flask, HTML, CSS, JS
Backend	Python, Flask, GPT-based LLMs (TinyLlama, Deepseek, etc.)
AI & NLP	Transformers, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, OCR
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
Storage	SQLite
IDEs	VS Code, Google Colab, Jupyter
Hosting (Future)	Cloud Platforms (TBD)
